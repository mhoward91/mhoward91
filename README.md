## 👋 Hi there! 

My name is Matt, and I'm a Management Consultant by trade. I started learning how to program to make me a more versatile consultant, but I immediately developed a passion. I was hooked. I set to work building the skills to turn this passion into a career - since 2020 I've invested my evenings, weekends and even some holidays into learning Python, its frameworks and other critical computer science concepts & skills. 

## 🧠 What I've learned 
#### Frameworks & Technologies
- Flask
- AWS - Lambda, API Gateway, Dynamo NoSQL databases
- SQL, SQLite, SQLAlchemy
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Beautiful Soup
- Tkinter

#### Key Skills
- Git, Git Bash, GitHub
- Data structures & algorithms (Big O, recursion, linked lists, stacks & queues, trees, graphs)
- Unit testing, test driven development
- Regular Expressions
- Debugging & error handling
- Markdown

## 🌱 What I’m currently learning

I'm learning how to build more advanced REST APIs with Flask, including how to effectively use Postman for test driven development, and post-development endpoint testing.

## 🦉 Professional Experience
- 4 + years experience in Management Consulting for clients in manufacturing, financial services, government and publishing
- Led change, process & organisation design workstreams for complex, agile system implementations in major UK organisations
- Advanced analytical, stakeholder management, workshop faciliation and presentation skills

## 👁️ I’m looking for

A role in software engineering or development where I can continue to grow my knowledge of Python and other languages, make a meaningful contribution, and be part of a great team.

## 💡 Last word - why I'm different
I bring a unique combination of technical skills, as well as the confidence, analytical ability, soft skills and professionalism from the consulting industry. I can collect and interpret requirements, write the code, and have conversations at the right level so people understand. Python isn't the only language I love - I speak Spanish fluently and am improving my French.
