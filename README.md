## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! 

My name is Matt, and I'm a Management Consultant-turned-Software Developer. I started learning how to program to make me a more versatile consultant, but I immediately developed a passion. I was hooked. I set to work building the skills to turn this passion into a career - since 2020 I've invested my evenings, weekends and even some holidays into learning Python, its frameworks and other critical computer science concepts & skills.

## ðŸ’¡ Last word - why I'm different
I bring a unique combination of technical skills, as well as the confidence, analytical ability, soft skills and professionalism from the consulting industry. I can collect and interpret requirements, implement & test the code, and have conversations at the right level so people understand.
