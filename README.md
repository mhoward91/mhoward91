## 👋 Hi there! 

My name is Matt, and I'm a Management Consultant by trade. I started learning how to program to make me a more versatile consultant, but I immediately developed a passion. I was hooked. I set to work building the skills to turn this passion into a career - since 2020 I've spent my evenings and weekends learning Python (and some SQL & Bash).

## 🌱 What I’m currently learning:

I'm learning how to build more advanced REST APIs with Flask, including how to use Postman for comprehensive testing.

## 👁️ I’m looking for:

A backend Engineering role where I can contribute to meaningful projects, listen & learn from peers to expand my knowledge, and be part of a great team. As well as the technical skills I've built and demonstrated on my page, I bring with me 4+ years of consulting experience - key analytical skills, stakeholder management & professional awareness of agile project work (largely in system led transformation programs) in some of the UK's largest organisations.
