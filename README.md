My name is Matt, and I'm a Management Consultant-turned-Software Developer. I started learning how to program to make me a more versatile consultant, but I immediately developed a passion. I was hooked. Between 2020 & 2022 I invested my evenings, weekends and even some holidays into building the skills to turn this passion into a career, and subsequently secured a full time developer role.
